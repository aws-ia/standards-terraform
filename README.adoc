## Taxonomy
**Root Module:**  Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, typically known as its root module. In the case of AWS-ia modules the Root module is always meant to be made up of reuseable modules or build blocks.

**Child Modules:** A module that has been called by another module is often referred to as a child module.

**Types of Reuseable AWS-ia Modules:**

- AWS-ia Service Modules: A container that provides a sensible default for deploying an AWS service based on AWS-ia standards _(Example: VPC/Aurora/SQS)_

- AWS-ia Partner Modules: A container that leverags one or more _AWS Service Modules_ to build the infrastructure needed to instantiate an AWS partner product _(Example: Magento)_

# Deploys example workload instance via root module
module "workload" {
  source = "../"
  # interface to be defined
  #
}
```

**File: `/main.tf`**

```
# Root Module
# No backends should be defined by default in Root Module
# This module is intended to be called by one or more other modules and must not contain any provider blocks
```

**File: `/setup_workspace/`**

Creates the Terraform workspace in TFC. See https://registry.terraform.io/modules/aws-ia/cloud_workspace/hashicorp/latest[registry] for more information


## Deployment Tyoes
**Local** - Write terraform state and configuration to local working dir
**Terraform Cloud** Writes terraform state and configuration to remote TFC workspace and stream it locally

NOTE: For more into in how to setup TFC Workspace refer to the https://registry.terraform.io/modules/aws-ia/cloud_workspace/hashicorp/latest[cloud_workspace module]

## Development Standards

### Minimum Terraform Version

**Binary Version** `1.0.5`

**Provider Version** ~> `v3.58.0`

#### AWS-ia Module Standards
Module `/main.tf` Must not contain provider block definitions

Deploy Example `/deploy/main.tf`
 - When creating an example terraform cloud deployment for the module are creating refer to the source directly.

```
module "self_deployment_example" {
  source = "../"
}
```

- If the example terraform cloud deployment requires a VPC or any other AWS Service use the Terraform registry path.
- Lock the version of any dependancies to the latest version at the time of release.

```
module "vpc" {
  source    = "aws-ia/vpv/aws"
  version   = "0.0.2"
  }
